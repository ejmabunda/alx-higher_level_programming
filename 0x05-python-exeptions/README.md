# Python exceptions
Exceptions are errors detected during executions. In this project, we're exploring how to handle them.

## Tasks
1. `safe_print_list` - prints `x` elements of a list, and returns the number of elements printed.
2. `2-safe_print_list_integers` - prints the first `x` elements of a list and only integers.
3. `3-safe_print_division` - divides 2 integers and prints the result.
