# Test-driven development in Python
## Overview
This project focuses on test-driven development (TDD) in Python, aiming to enhance your understanding of Python programming concepts and the importance of writing tests and documentation first before implementing the actual code.
## Usage
Tasks were tested Python's doctest module:
```
python3 -m doctest ./tests/*
```
Unittests were used for the last task:
```
python3 -m unittest tests.6-max_integer_test
```
