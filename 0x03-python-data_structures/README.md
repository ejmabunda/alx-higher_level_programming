# Python data structures
This project explores lists. A list is a data structure designed to store data of the same type, that is accessed with indexes. Lists can be used to create more complex structures like stacks and queues.

## Usage
```
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(my_list[2]) // prints 3
```

## Tasks
1. `0-print_list_integer.py` - prints all integers of a list.
2. `1-element_at.py` - retrieves an element from a list
